# Web-Contacts
A Test given to me to be hired in a company as an intern mobile Developer. 
It's purpose is to create an iOS app that downloads some contacts informations as JSON
parses it and shows it to the user in a UICollectionView and each time the user touches a contact photo on the collection view
he's taken to a UITableView to see the contact in detail (phone,email,ssn...).
There's also a local serach engine that needs to be implemented so that we can search for contacts.

If u wanna see how the result looks like check the issues.
